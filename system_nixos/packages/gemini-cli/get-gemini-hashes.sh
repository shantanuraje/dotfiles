# Gemini CLI Hash Updater Script
# This script automatically fetches and updates the required hashes for the Nix package
# 
# Usage: ./get-gemini-hashes.sh
# 
# This script performs the following steps:
# 1. Fetches the source hash from GitHub using nix-prefetch-github
# 2. Updates the gemini-cli.nix file with the correct source hash
# 3. Attempts to build the package to get the npm dependencies hash
# 4. The build will fail but display the correct npmDepsHash to use
#
# After running this script, you'll need to manually update the npmDepsHash
# in gemini-cli.nix with the value shown in the error message.

# Exit on any error
